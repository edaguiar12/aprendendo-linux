This is a repository where i record all my experiences in Shell scripts and Git/Github itself.

Disclaimer: All of that experiences are recent, so i highly don't recommend using this as example.. if you want to do that, be aware that you are on your won.

Any tip or help i would really aprecciate. Tks!
